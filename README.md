# Vix
https://travis-ci.org/stefanoborini/vix.svg?branch=master

Vix is an editor that wants to be more than that. Most important of all, 
it wants to be a better vim.

We love vim, but we want more. We want a terminal-based IDE that looks like vim,
handles like vim, but has all those nice features of Eclipse and Sublime, is
integrated with git, and is fully coded in python. 

Vix foundation rests on VixTk, a terminal UI toolkit heavily inspired by Qt.
At the moment, VixTk is part of Vix, but it will eventually become a product 
in its own merit.

Main development:
